# Sustainable Solutions
Welcome to our launch page!

## Who we are
  - Aubri Henke: Team Leader/Software Developer
  - Ricky Flores: Quality Assurance/Scribe
  - Hugo Corado: Tech Support
  - John Hare: Architect
  
## What we do
  Our application allows the user to view data that shows them their monthly solar input, output, and if they should be careful with usage for the month.
  
  - Beam Irradiance: Solar Energy that the sun is outputting
  - Diffuse Irradiance: Solar Enrgy that is hitting the solar panel
  - Total Irradiance: Solar Energy that the panel is taking in to be converted into electricity
  - DC Array Output: Raw electricity that is being outputted
  - AC System Output: Electricity that has been converted to be used by appliances
  
  The application will display the percentage of what is being used and if you should limit your usage.
  
## Looking ahead
  In the coming weeks we will add the ability for a user to make their own account and login, spruce up the website with visuals such as graphs and charts, and add the ability to change between hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly usage output.
